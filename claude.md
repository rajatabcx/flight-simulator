# 3D Cape Flying Simulator - Project Plan

## Project Overview

We're building a 3D cape flying simulator exploration game with a
programming/coding theme. Players will create accounts, fly through a world
organized by programming domains, and discover landmarks representing different
technologies and concepts.

## Core Features

### World & Environment

- **Terrain**: Mountains, valleys, rivers, oceans, underground tunnels
- **Settlements**: Cities and villages representing programming domains
- **Weather & Time**: Day/night cycle, rain, clear skies
- **Landmarks**: Specific technology representations, interactive monuments
- **Atmosphere**: Coding-themed visual elements throughout

### Player Experience

- **Movement**: Cape flying/gliding with physics
- **Exploration**: Discover areas representing different programming domains
- **Progression**: Track visited areas and achievements
- **Perspective**: First-person with option to switch to third-person view

### Technical Architecture

#### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **3D Rendering**:
  - Three.js core
  - React Three Fiber for React integration
  - React Three Drei for helper components and ready-made solutions
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Animation**: GSAP for UI animations, Three.js animations for 3D

#### Backend

- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes or separate Express server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data and exploration tracking
- **ORM**: Prisma for database interactions
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for user accounts
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend, Vercel Postgres or Railway for database

### Additional Libraries

- **Physics**: Rapier.js for 3D physics
- **Models**: Ready-made 3D models + custom models
- **Audio**: Howler.js for sound effects and ambient audio
- **Asset Loading**: Draco compression for 3D models
- **Performance**: R3F-Perf for monitoring

## Required 3D Models

To create an immersive and engaging flying experience, we need the following 3D
models:

### Environment Models

- **Terrain Features**:
  - Various tree types (pine, oak, palm for different biomes)
  - Mountain ranges and rock formations
  - Rivers, lakes, and ocean surfaces
  - Underground cave systems
- **Atmospheric Elements**:
  - Clouds (cumulus, cirrus, storm clouds)
  - Hot air balloons floating in the sky
  - Birds flying individually or in flocks
  - Weather effects (rain particles, lightning, fog)
  - Sun, moon, and stars for day/night cycle

### Programming Domain Landmarks

- **Domain-Specific Structures**:
  - Frontend city with HTML/CSS/JS monuments
  - Backend fortress with database structures
  - Mobile development island
  - AI/ML research laboratory
  - Game development arcade
  - Cybersecurity fortress
- **Technology Representations**:
  - Buildings shaped like programming language logos
  - Monuments representing famous algorithms or data structures
  - Interactive technology monuments that demonstrate concepts

### Interactive Elements

- **Gameplay Objects**:
  - Collectible items (representing achievements or knowledge)
  - Waypoints/checkpoints for navigation
  - Portals between different programming domains
  - Information panels/floating text with programming facts
  - Challenge areas with puzzles

### Player-Related Models

- **Character Customization**:
  - Different cape designs and colors
  - Trail effects for the cape while flying
  - Shadow effects for the player
  - First-person hands/arms for interactions

### UI Elements (3D or 2D)

- **Navigation Aids**:
  - Compass or minimap elements
  - Altitude indicator
  - Speed indicator
  - Domain/area name displays
  - Achievement notifications

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Movement

1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up Three.js environment with React Three Fiber
3. Implement basic character controller
4. Create simple terrain for testing
5. Develop cape physics for flying/gliding

### Phase 2: World Building

1. Design and generate terrain (mountains, valleys, water)
2. Create basic city structures for programming domains
3. Implement day/night cycle
4. Add weather system (rain)
5. Design and place initial landmarks

### Phase 3: Game Systems

1. Implement user authentication
2. Create exploration tracking system
3. Develop UI for game information
4. Add minimap and navigation aids
5. Implement save/checkpoint system

### Phase 4: Content and Polish

1. Add detailed landmarks for each programming domain
2. Enhance visual effects and lighting
3. Implement audio system with ambient sounds
4. Optimize performance for various devices
5. Add tutorials and guidance system

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

1. Perform cross-browser testing
2. Optimize loading times and assets
3. Deploy to production environment
4. Setup monitoring and analytics
5. Prepare for user feedback and iterations

## Code Architecture

### Directory Structure

```
/app
  /api              # API routes
  /(routes)         # App router pages
  /components       # UI components
/models             # 3D models and assets
/lib
  /game             # Game logic
  /hooks            # Custom hooks
  /store            # State management
  /utils            # Utility functions
/prisma             # Database schema
/public             # Static assets
```

### Key Components

- **WorldManager**: Handles world generation and management
- **PlayerController**: Manages player movement and physics
- **GameState**: Global state management for game data
- **TerrainGenerator**: Procedural terrain generation
- **WeatherSystem**: Controls weather effects
- **TimeSystem**: Manages day/night cycle
- **UIOverlay**: Game interface elements

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Level of detail (LOD) for distant objects
- Frustum culling for objects outside camera view
- Instanced meshes for repetitive elements
- Texture atlasing to reduce draw calls
- Asset preloading and streaming

### Mobile Compatibility

- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Graphics quality settings based on device capability

### Accessibility

- Configurable controls
- Visual indicators for important elements
- Text alternatives for critical game information

## Next Steps

1. Set up initial project skeleton
2. Implement basic 3D scene with character
3. Develop cape physics prototype
4. Begin terrain generation
5. Set up user authentication system
